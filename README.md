## PrimePiece Tokenization 
- The Ulam Spiral: We start by arranging integers in a square spiral. When we highlight the prime numbers on this grid, they often form surprising diagonal lines and patterns. This suggests there are hidden structures we can exploit.
- Vocabulary as Coordinates: Instead of treating a prime number like 23 as a sequence of digits '2', '3', PrimePiece will first find its unique (x, y) coordinate on the Ulam Spiral.
